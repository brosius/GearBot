 * This command is used for running the drive during auto
 * When programming auto you call this command and pass through a string and an integer
 * The string is based off of the function you want to run
 * The integer is the amount of time you want the function to run
 * The command is designed to run in sequence of multiple instances
 * At the end of the command the drive stops automatically
 *

 * for = forward
 * back = backwards
 * clock = clockwise (spins on a point clockwise)
 * cc = counterclockwise (spins on a point counterclockwise)
 * left = left (kind of pivots towards the left)
 * right = right (kind of pivots towards the right)
 * stop = stop
